Internship DAO for Students â€“ Community-Managed Listings
ðŸ“œ Description

  The Internship DAO for Students is an Aptos Move smart contract that enables students to create and manage internship listings in a decentralized and community-governed manner.
  This contract allows any student to publish their internship opportunity with a title and description, and anyone can view the listings directly on-chain.

ðŸŽ¯ Vision

  Our vision is to empower students with a transparent, decentralized, and collaborative platform to share and discover internship opportunities without relying on centralized job portals.
  By using blockchain technology, we aim to ensure data integrity, ownership of listings, and equal access to opportunities for everyone.

  Verification Badge â€“ DAO-based verification for trusted internship providers.
  
  Multi-listing Support â€“ Allow students to post multiple internships under one address.
